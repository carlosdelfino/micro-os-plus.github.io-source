## Overview

The **xPacks** / **XCDL** technology provides the glue code that keeps all these components together and allows to create projects based on them.

XCDL is a component framework, a set of metadata definitions and a collection of tools designed to manage packages and package based embedded projects.

## Motivation

XCDL was created both as a proposal for a future CMSIS, and to overcome the limitations/problems of the current CMSIS Pack design, among them the very limited support for inter-packages configuration.

## Links

The [XCDL project](https://github.com/xcdl) is also hosted on GitHub, and has a separate documentation [web site](http://xcdl.github.io).

The packages created using XCDL are hosted in the separate [xPacks project](https://github.com/xpacks), also hosted on GitHub.
