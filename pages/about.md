## _Perfekt ist nicht gut genug_

Some time ago, while watching a TV documentary about Porsche, I heard this line and I liked it. If this is indeed one of Porsche mottos, then thank you Porsche for it (and for the beautiful designs). (English: _"Perfect is not good enough"_)

## This site

The first project wiki was created in November 2010 using the SourceForge hosted apps.
