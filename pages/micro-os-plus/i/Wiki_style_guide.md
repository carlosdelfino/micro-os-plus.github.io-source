This document defines the recommended conventions for structuring and formatting the wiki documents used in the ÂµOS++ project.

Headers
=======

The structure of the documents should be defined by a reasonable amount of headers.

The first level of headers should use = H1 =, the second should use == H2 ==, and so on.

Regular documents usually require no more than 3 levels, maybe 4 for longer documents. Excessive use of headers should be avoided. The criteria for deciding when there are too many is the aspect of the Table of Contents; if the TOC seems to be too detailed, than the headers are in excess.

Lists
=====

The recommended lists are bulleted lists.

Numbered lists should be used when the order of the members is important, for example in classifications, like "Top 10 Something".

Indentation
===========

Tables
======

The recommended style for tables is class="wikitable".

Punctuation
===========

The usual rule with punctuation signs is to use a space after, and never use a space before.

The notable exceptions are:

-   open parenthesis/brackets
-   open apostrophe
-   open quotation marks
