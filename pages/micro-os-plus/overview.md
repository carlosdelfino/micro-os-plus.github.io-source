## Overview

The µOS++ IIIe (micro oh ɛs plus plus third edition) project  (affectionately called Ilie, Romanian for [Eliyahu/Илия́/Elijah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah), also the protector of aviators) is the third iteration of µOS++, an open source, royalty-free, multi-tasking operating system intended for 8/16/32/64 bit embedded systems, written in C++.

The corner stone of µOS++ IIIe is [CMSIS++ RTOS API]({{ site.baseurl }}/cmsis-plus/), and the relationship is reciprocal, since µOS++ provides CMSIS++ the reference implementation for the CMSIS++ syncronisation objects (mutex, semaphore, etc) and for the CMSIS++ scheduler.
