# The CMSIS++ / µOS++ IIIe web site source


## Overview

This GitHub project, available from [micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus.github.io-source](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus.github.io-source), contains the source files used to generate the **CMSIS++ / µOS++ IIIe**.

## Destination URL

The **CMSIS++ / µOS++ IIIe web site** is an organisation [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site, stored in the [micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus.github.io](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus.github.io) Git and publicly available from [http://micro-os-plus.github.io](http://micro-os-plus.github.io).


## Jekyll

The web site is generated off-line by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It cannot be generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) because it uses Jekyll plug-ins, considered unsafe and disabled by the GitHub Pages instance of Jekyll.

## Prerequisites

To be able to run the Jekyll build process, the `ruby` interpreter and the `gem` tool are required. In OS X 10.10.5, these tools are preinstalled, at least when the Developer Command Line tools are present.

	$ ruby --version
	ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14]
	$ gem --version
	2.0.14
	$ sudo gem install jekyll
	...
	$ jekyll --version
	jekyll 2.5.3


In addition, the several specific gems are required:

	$ sudo gem install jekyll-mentions jemoji jekyll-redirect-from jekyll-feed jekyll-sitemap jekyll-last-modified-at



## Clone Git

To manage the web site, a local copy of this repository is required.

	$ git clone https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus.github.io-source.git micro-os-plus.github.io-source.git

## Development

The current development cycle is edit-save-build-view.

The build can be performed automatically by Jekyll when started in server mode.

	$ cd micro-os-plus.github.io-source.git
	$ jekyll serve --baseurl "" --trace --port 40001

To view the result, point the browser to `localhost:4001`.

## Publish

The build result is in the `_site` folder.

This folder is configured as a submodule, linked to the [micro-os-plus.github.io](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus.github.io) project.

To publish, just commit this Git and the new site will be automatically updated.

## Folder structure

### Posts

All blog posts are in the `_posts` folder.

### Pages

All web pages are in the `pages` folder.

## 'last\_modified\_at:'

To maintain sitelink.xml usefulness, while maintaining pages and posts, it is necessary to keep this variable up-to-date. When the pages are generated off-line, this field is automatically updated by a plug-in.

## Timezone

As per `_config.yml`, the default timezone is UTC. For other timezones, set it explicitly as offset (for example +0300)

## Images

The embedded images are located in the `/assets/images` folder.


For a certain degree of portability, the recommended editable format is PPTX. On macOS, PPTX files can be processed with Keynote, although saving can be done only indirectly via **Export To**, not directly via **Save**.

The preferred format is PNG. The available width is lower than 700 px, but apparently Jekyll scales images properly. By default Keynote exports images as 1024 x 768, which is generally ok for regular (non-HiRes) screens.
